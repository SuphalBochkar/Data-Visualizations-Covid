# Tableau Interactive Dashboards

This repository showcases two Tableau projects that highlight interactive data visualizations: the **Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard** and the **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard**. Each project uses Tableau's powerful features to present data in visually appealing and insightful ways, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Projects

### 1. Interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard: Visualizing Superstore Sales

In this project, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze the **Superstore Sales** dataset. It provides insights into sales, profits, discounts, and geographic distribution across different regions in the USA. Key visualizations include:

- **Overall Sales 2024**: A comprehensive view of the total sales in 2024.
- **Sales Donut Chart**: Visualization of sales distribution by region, segment, and category.
- **Profit and Discount Donut Charts**: Insights into profitability and discount practices.
- **Sales vs Profit for December**: Detailed month-end analysis for December.

### 2. COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard

This project visualizes the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries. The dashboard provides insights into case numbers, deaths, testing data, and trends from 2019 to 2022. Key features include:

- **Overall Cases by Country**: Snapshot of COVID-19 cases as of June 2020.
